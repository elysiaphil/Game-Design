- **Introduction:** A brief overview of the application/game, its purpose, and its target audience.
  Adventure Game, Divergent: What is your faction?; This game's purpose is to put the player in a simulation (based off the Divergent book series/movies) that tests their decisions and choices, later leading them to a result of whether they are Dauntless(brave), Amity(kind), Erudite(intelligent), Agnegation(selfless), Candor(honest), Divergent, or Factionless.
  Purpose: Kind of like a personality test, opportunity for players to learn more about themselves-- also for fun! especially if you like the movies, kind of a fun adaptation.

Users will have an option to play a more kid-friendly version, which will be an adventure game similar to Super Mario -- characters and elements can be less realistic
OR
Have option to be a more Shooter/Platformer game -- more realistic and an option for more graphic/violent choices and fears the player has to navigate through
