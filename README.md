# Game-Design

- **Introduction:** A brief overview of the application/game, its purpose, and its target audience.

- Adventure Game, Divergent: What is your faction?; This game's purpose is to put the player in a simulation (based off the Divergent book series/movies) that tests their decisions and choices, later leading them to a result of whether they are Dauntless(brave), Amity(kind), Erudite(intelligent), Agnegation(selfless), Candor(honest), Divergent (Embody all the factions), or Factionless.

- Purpose: Kind of like a personality test, opportunity for players to learn more about themselves-- also for fun! especially if you like the movies, kind of a fun adaptation.
- Target Audience: Teenagers, Adults -- anyone who likes the movies or just wants to have fun customizing their character.

- **Value/Use:** A clear and explicit explanation of the value or use provided by the application/game.

- Opportunity to understand yourself and what you might do in dangerous situations, how you communicate with loved ones, or how you naviagte common fears: spiders, heights, snakes, etc. Similar to a personality test.

- **User Interaction and Experience:** A description of how users will interact with the application/game and what their experience will be like.

- Users will have an option to play a more kid-friendly version, which will be an adventure game similar to Super Mario -- characters and elements can be less realistic.
  OR
  Have option to be a more Shooter/Platformer game -- more realistic and an option for more graphic/violent choices and fears the player has to navigate through
- I'd like it to be a viewpoint similar to Minecraft-- as if the user is looking through the eyes of their character-- but can customize their outfits and appearance.

- **Competitive Element:** Details on how the application/game facilitates competition among students.

- Can have a Multiplayer mode, that connects friends to the same simulation. Those who complete the sim faster can have access to extra levels, free clothes, sidekicks, and chances to unlock new characters.

- **Engagement and Addictiveness Strategies:** An explanation of the features or strategies employed to make the application/game engaging and addictive.

- Colorful -- not just beige, black, white colors but realistic -- Maybe has a feature that cycles through a day like minecraft where sim begins in the morning with a sunrise and cycles through the day-- until you're out of time once its dark and stars are out (by then should be done with simulation)
- Opportunity to unlock new clothes, can get piercings or tattoos, and maybe even create a house for yourself in your faction at the end of the simulation

- **Scalability and Expansion:** A discussion of how the design allows for future growth and adoption beyond the initial homework assignment.
- Beyond just a simulation can create a whole Divergent/Sim City world with your friends, classmates, and family. After you are placed into a category can create a home for yourself, jobs, have a family, significant other, pets, etc. -- Could have friends over to your faction -- and could redo the sim and live in different factions if the user continues to play.

- **Accessibility and Inclusivity:** A section detailing how the design adheres to the California non-discrimination clause and ensures inclusivity for all potential users.

- Subtitles available for those who are deaf and voice narration for those who are blind. Within the game itself you are able to choose your race and physical appearance, but there will be a no harrassment and bullying code.
